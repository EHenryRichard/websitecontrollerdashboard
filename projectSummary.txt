## DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

### Before Deploying
- [ ] All features tested locally
- [ ] Environment variables documented
- [ ] Database schema finalized
- [ ] AWS S3 bucket created
- [ ] Telegram bot created
- [ ] Email service configured

### Deployment Steps
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Connect Vercel to GitHub repo
3. Set up Supabase project
4. Convert MySQL schema to PostgreSQL (AI assistance)
5. Add environment variables in Vercel
6. Deploy
7. Test all features in production
8. Monitor for errors

---

## IMPORTANT RULES

### Development Rules
1. **Work in focused 2-3 hour blocks**
2. **Commit to GitHub daily**
3. **If stuck for 30+ minutes, simplify or ask for help**
4. **Use AI tools to speed up coding**
5. **Ugly but working > pretty but broken**
6. **Test as you build, don't wait till the end**

### Feature Cutting Strategy
**If behind by Day 4:**
- Cut message scheduler (add later)
- Focus on Sites Manager + Backup only

**If behind by Day 6:**
- Skip Telegram integration
- Use email only
- Deploy what you have

### After Day 7
**STOP BUILDING THIS PROJECT** (finished or not)

**October 20, 2025:** START PORTFOLIO PROJECT

---

## POST-DEPLOYMENT PLAN

### Week 2 (Oct 20-27)
- Build portfolio project (simple, demoable)
- Use current skills (React, Next, Node)
- Make it public and showcase-worthy
- Start applying for better freelance work

### Success Metrics
- Dashboard deployed and working
- Using it to manage your sites
- Portfolio project completed
- Applied to 5+ better-paying gigs
- Reduced time spent on site management

---

## COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID

1. **Perfectionism** - Ship functional, not perfect
2. **Feature creep** - Stick to the plan, no extras
3. **Over-engineering** - Simple solutions first
4. **Getting stuck** - Ask for help quickly
5. **Skipping testing** - Test each feature as you build
6. **Ignoring the deadline** - Day 7 is the hard stop
